Whether it's for promoting an event, displaying information, or a creating a poster, something is always cropping up that requires a bit of creative finagling. So if you're not a designer, and don't have the money to pay for one (we are expensive!), I'll share a handful of tips and themes that you can employ to help take even the most visually-challenged design and turn it into an effective project. This won't be a technical talk about how to use Illustrator or Photoshop, but more of a high-level collection of ways to approach a design project."},"gsx$video":{"$t":"http://compsci.capture.duke.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer/Default.aspx?id\u003d19e4c148-69f6-4d72-b001-526114e7381c"},"gsx$videonotes":{"$t":""},"gsx$slides":{"$t":""},"gsx$slidesnotes":{"$t":""}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1x_pPSVaxifb1EpqqKeQfUYyTkuVt0_7oYwqHcLhHDME/od4/public/values/d2mkx"},"updated":{"$t":"2016-07-28T13:41:55.267Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"4/5/2013"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"speaker: Christopher Collins, affiliation: Assistant Professor of CS, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, title: Designing Multiple Relation Visualizations: Case Studies from Text Analytics, abstract: Datasets often have both explicit relations (e.g. citations between papers in a data set, links in a parse tree), and implicit relations (e.g. papers by the same author, words that start with the same letter).
