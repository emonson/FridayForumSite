These virtual trees were rendered in a hardware analog of a ray-tracing light model to estimate the integrated annual light levels throughout the canopy volume. This project lends itself naturally to several visualization techniques, which I use to convey both the methods of analysis and the results of the study. These methods include animations and virtual \u0026quot;fly-throughs,\u0026quot; slices extracted from data cubes, and the use of color and shading to convey different types of information visually and to tie together different parts of the study."},"gsx$video":{"$t":""},"gsx$videonotes":{"$t":""},"gsx$slides":{"$t":""},"gsx$slidesnotes":{"$t":""}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1x_pPSVaxifb1EpqqKeQfUYyTkuVt0_7oYwqHcLhHDME/ocu/public/values/cssly"},"updated":{"$t":"2016-07-28T13:41:55.267Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"4/21/2006"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"title: Morphometric Analysis of Primate Sensory Adaptations Using High Resolution Computed Tomography, speaker: Michael Malinzak, affiliation: BAA, abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) permits extensive and non-destructive study of both recent and fossilized primate cranial specimens. Special sensory adaptations are among the most salient and conserved anatomic features of the primate cranium. Using CT-based comparative methods, we seek to better understand the functional and evolutionary basis of morphologic variation with particular regard to the visual and vestibular systems.
