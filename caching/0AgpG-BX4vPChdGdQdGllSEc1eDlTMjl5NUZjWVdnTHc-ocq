The basic tenets of ChucK include a syntax for representing audio flow, a new time-based programming model that allows developers to precisely control time across parallel program components (we call this \"strongly-timed\"), and facilities to rapidly experiment with audio programs \"on-the-fly\" (i.e., as they run). A ChucKian approach to \"on-the-fly programming\" as a new musical performance paradigm is also discussed, which in turn motivates the Audicle: a specialized graphical environment to visualize ChucK programs (as well as the audio programming process) in real-time.

These images--and the stories they accompany--have consequences. As they disseminate information, they affect survival rates and contagion routes. They promote or mitigate the stigmatizing of individuals, groups, populations, locales (regional and global), behaviors and lifestyles, and they change economies. They also influence how both scientists and the lay public understand the nature and consequences of infection, how we imagine the threat and why we react so fearfully to some disease outbreaks and not others at least as dangerous and pressing, as well as which problems merit our attention and resources."},"gsx$video":{"$t":""},"gsx$videonotes":{"$t":""},"gsx$slides":{"$t":""},"gsx$slidesnotes":{"$t":""}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/0AgpG-BX4vPChdGdQdGllSEc1eDlTMjl5NUZjWVdnTHc/ocq/public/values/d2mkx"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-01-21T14:57:47.197Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"4/4/2008"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"speaker: David Brady, affiliation: Electrical Engineering, title: Dimensionality in imaging systems, abstract: An image is an ordered list of data.

In particular, I will introduce a notion of heat coordinates (similar to GPS triangulation) on (undirected) graphs that (provably) allows to map large \"almost-Euclidean\" portions of a graph into low-dimensional Euclidean space, while \"almost\" preserving all pairwise distances, in a way that is robust to noise.

The dendritic form is a recurrent and often instructive one in the sciences, which can be observed in many contexts and at different scales, from the delta of liquid methane revealed by the Huygens probe on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan in 2005, to micrographs of neurons in the human brain. It also recurs in the form of the persuasive diagrams which art historians, linguists and philosophers have long used to bring forth a sense of organic unity, order and development from their data.
