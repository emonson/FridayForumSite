Computer simulation involves computer generated phantoms, models of the imaging process, and fast computational methods. Computer phantoms provide a model of the subject's anatomy and physiology. Given a model of the physics of the imaging process, acquired data of a computer phantom can be generated using the computational methods. A major advantage to using computer-generated phantoms in simulation studies is that the exact anatomy and physiological functions of the phantom are known, thus providing a gold standard from which to evaluate and improve medical imaging devices and image processing and reconstruction techniques. Other advantages are that computer phantoms are always willing participants and can be altered easily to model different anatomies and medical situations providing a large population of subjects from which to perform research. A vital aspect of simulation is to have a realistic phantom or model of the subject's anatomy. Without this, the results of the simulation may not be indicative of what would occur in actual patients or animal subjects and would, therefore, have limited practical value.

In this talk we show data directly measuring temporal fluctuations in vascular pO2 in three rat tumors, showing that O2 delivery to tumors is constantly fluctuating. We will discuss visualization problems in our initial approach of the data, the application of spatial statistics to characterizing the spatial as well as temporal differences between tumor types, and the application of spatial statistics to garner insight into the biological mechanisms behind fluctuations in tumor oxygenation."},"gsx$video":{"$t":""},"gsx$videonotes":{"$t":""},"gsx$slides":{"$t":""},"gsx$slidesnotes":{"$t":""}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1x_pPSVaxifb1EpqqKeQfUYyTkuVt0_7oYwqHcLhHDME/ocr/public/values/d2mkx"},"updated":{"$t":"2016-07-28T13:41:55.267Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"11/16/2007"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"speaker: Doug Bowman, affiliation: Computer Science, Virginia Tech, title: Quantifying the Benefits of Immersive Visualization, abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR), typified by technologies such as stereoscopic projected displays and 3D tracking systems, has been available for many years, but there are only a few examples of real-world applications of this technology, most of which are focused on providing a realistic \"experience\" to the user so that he experiences a sense of \"presence.\" We believe that immersive technologies can provide other benefits, such as increased spatial understanding or reduced information clutter.
