Since sound travels so well underwater, marine animals, including Hawaiian spinner dolphins, rely heavily on sound as their primary means of communicating and sensing the environment, and use sound for critical life functions. Marine animal sounds, the sounds from geological features and processes and sounds from humans come together to form the soundscape, the sounds in a place at any given time. Given the importance of sound for marine animals, it is key to monitor the soundscape of significant marine habitats like Hawaiian spinner dolphin resting bays. We used recording equipment to assess the soundscape of four known spinner dolphin resting bays on the Kona Coast of Hawaii Island.  Between January 8, 2011 and March 30, 2013 we recorded more than 150,000 30-second recordings in each of the four bays.  With this large amount of data in hand, our goal was to to establish a baseline for soundscape in these four critically important areas, understand normal variability within and across the four sites and assess the effects of natural and human-caused events on the soundscape. We identified sources of very loud sound in the bays: aquaculture noise, boat noise, and sonar and quantified these soundscape disturbances. We also used the tsunami event of March 2011 to approximate what a natural soundscape in these bays would look and sound like and to put the human-made soundscape disruptions into context. We found that dolphins utilize bays to rest at a time when they are much quieter than nighttime noise levels. Utilizing bays when they are quiet may help the dolphins maximize rest and optimize passive detection of predators and/or intraspecific acoustic communication.

How can students reimagine the structure and presentation of a humanities essay through spatiotemporal visualization? In Spring 2015, the teaching team and students in ARTHIST 101 Introduction to Art History explored both of these questions using Neatline, a plugin for the Omeka content management system. Neatline combines temporal, spatial, textual, and pictorial forms, enabling students and scholars to create interactive non-linear visual narratives. This course’s use of a visual syllabus and visual essay assignments engaged students and readers with representations of art historical narratives that highlight spatial, temporal, and conceptual relationships."},"gsx$video":{"$t":"http://compsci.capture.duke.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id\u003d555575a3-fc02-4ee0-b2bc-348512a2623a"},"gsx$videonotes":{"$t":""},"gsx$slides":{"$t":""},"gsx$slidesnotes":{"$t":""},"gsx$livestream":{"$t":"http://compsci.capture.duke.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id\u003d555575a3-fc02-4ee0-b2bc-348512a2623a"}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1x_pPSVaxifb1EpqqKeQfUYyTkuVt0_7oYwqHcLhHDME/ocqnff2/public/values/cyevm"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-12-11T12:54:10.655Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"10/23/2015"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"speaker: Margaret Brown, affiliation: Duke Libraries Exhibits Coordinator, title: Thinking Inside the Box: Transforming an Idea into an Exhibit, abstract: Have you ever wondered when you saw a display what went into creating it?
