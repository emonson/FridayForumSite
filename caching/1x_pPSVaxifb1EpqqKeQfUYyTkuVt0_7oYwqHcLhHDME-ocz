This talk will start with a brief, visually-aided introduction to queueing as a modeling paradigm. The focus of the talk will then turn to heavy traffic analysis, an approach to approximating queueing systems whose dynamics are so complex that they defy simple analytic expression. Animation will be used to validate and illustrate the results of heavy traffic analysis."},"gsx$video":{"$t":""},"gsx$videonotes":{"$t":""},"gsx$slides":{"$t":""},"gsx$slidesnotes":{"$t":""}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1x_pPSVaxifb1EpqqKeQfUYyTkuVt0_7oYwqHcLhHDME/ocz/public/values/d2mkx"},"updated":{"$t":"2016-07-28T13:41:55.267Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"4/8/2011"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"speaker: Craig Roberts, affiliation: Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, title: Dynamic Classroom Instruction, abstract: Classroom instruction and assessment is predominately administered through text.
