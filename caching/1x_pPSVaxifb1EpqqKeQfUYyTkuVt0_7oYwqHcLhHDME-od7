Even better, an animation... and even better than that, is an interactive animation. Throw in a little virtual reality and it's a great medium to foster understanding of abstract concepts that are taught typically on paper. This presentation discusses two programs developed for the DiVE (and for the web) that integrate chemistry, biology, a bit of physics, computer science, and art. One program, \"Smoking in the DiVE\", shows how the brain changes with repeated smoking -- one \"smokes\" to visualize both graphically, and biologically, the development of tolerance. Viewers will \"ride\" the brain pathway involved in \"pleasure\", chasing electrical impulses to the front of the brain. The other program, developed by a student team, is called \"DiVE into Alcohol\". The interactive animation helps the participant learn how alcohol is oxidized in the liver. The viewer travels inside the enzyme's active site to play the game -- move the correct atoms to oxidize the alcohol.
